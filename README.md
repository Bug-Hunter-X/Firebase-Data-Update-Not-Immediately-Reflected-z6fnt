# Firebase Data Update Not Immediately Reflected

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in Firebase where a data update isn't immediately reflected after a successful write operation.  The core problem lies in the asynchronous nature of Firebase's database interactions.  While the `set()` operation might successfully write data, the subsequent read operation using `once('value')` might not retrieve the latest data immediately.

## Reproduction

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and configure the `firebase.js` file with your project's configuration.
3.  Run the `bug.js` file. Observe that the console output might not show the updated data immediately.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution using `on('value')` to listen for real-time data changes, addressing the asynchronous issue.

## Additional Notes

This issue is not a bug in Firebase, but rather a consequence of how asynchronous operations function.  It is crucial to understand this behavior when interacting with Firebase's real-time database.
